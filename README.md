# Dicey

## Goal

The objective of this project is to introduce you to the core programming concepts like Variables, Constants, Arrays and Randomisation that will form a strong foundation for building most apps. This app will teach you a lot of important programming knowledge, while building a neat dice app called DICEY

## What i've done

It's a dice app called DICEY. You can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!


## Ideas Implemented

* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* using comments to annotate code.
* using Swift constants and variables.
* using collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Testing and debugging the app with the Xcode console.
* implementing what i've learnt about randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.
